''' source_address(source) is code to identify the source IP address for the traceroute.
The code includes the ability to validate a manually input IP address matched against an ip_pattern,
but is not included as a feature for a first release. More debugging has to occur before it is a fully
working feature. Error handling is included for future features.'''
